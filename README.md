This package utilizes OpenCV 4 to perform the image processing required to obtain the positional data of the tip point of a flexible link. The code uses an [OAK-D camera](https://shop.luxonis.com/products/oak-d) and only uses RGB image to perform the analyses.
There is a marker mounted at the tip point, and the code utilized an hsv-filter approach to obtain the centre of area of the marker.

below a sample link & object detection using this code has been demonstrated.
